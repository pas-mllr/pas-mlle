I'm an independent tech consultant specializing in AI and digital transformation. After over a decade in consulting, I went solo to help businesses make real use of emerging tech, particularly AI.

I run **Lurn Digital**, my consulting firm. Currently, I'm working with a global energy company to help transform how tax & finance teams work. I also support small businesses and non-profits, leveraging technology to drive impactful change.

I've represented my firm at major tech events, including an international tech conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, discussing AI's impact on industries as part of the Dutch government-led delegation.

I'm a volunteer board member at **TechLabs Rotterdam**, where I help provide free digital education. I lead the AI track, guiding groups through the basics of AI and pushing forward initiatives that bring digital fluency to people ready to take the next step. 

I'm interested in projects and collaborations, especially around tech and social impact.
