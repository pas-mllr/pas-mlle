I'm an independent tech consultant specializing in AI and digital transformation. After over a decade in consulting, I went solo to help businesses make real use of emerging tech, particularly AI.

I run **Lurn Digital**, my consulting firm. Currently, I'm working with a global energy company to transform their tax and finance teams using AI. I also support small businesses and non-profits, leveraging technology to drive impactful change.

I've represented my firm at major tech events, including an international tech conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, discussing AI's impact on industries as part of the Dutch government-led delegation.

I'm a volunteer board member at **TechLabs Rotterdam**, where I help provide free digital education. I lead the AI track, guiding groups through the basics of AI and pushing forward initiatives that bring accessible knowledge to people ready to take the next step.
