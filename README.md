# Hi, I'm Pascal

### About Me

I'm an independent tech consultant specializing in AI and digital transformation, with extensive experience not only in consulting but also in banking and government. After over a decade in consulting, I went solo to help businesses make real use of emerging tech, particularly AI.

I run **Lurn Digital**, my consulting firm. Right now, I'm working with a large company to transform their tax and finance teams with AI. I also work with small businesses and non-profits to leverage technology effectively.

I've represented my firm at major tech events, including an international tech conference, joining the Dutch government-led delegation to discuss AI's role in shaping the future of industries.

### Community Involvement

I'm a board member at a non-profit offering free digital education. I lead the AI track, guiding groups through the basics of AI. Recently, I represented my firm and the non-profit at an international tech conference as part of the Dutch government delegation, contributing to discussions on AI and the future of tech.
